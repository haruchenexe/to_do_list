1. Create a dashboard which allows user to create a project 
2. Create a button that allows user to create a form that will require user to enter the following list
3. Each project should be desgined as the following:
    Design: What kind of properties do I want my todo list webpage to contain?
        - minimum:
            - title
            - description
            - dueDate
            - priority
            - notes
            - checklist

    When the user first load the page a default project todos should be listed for the user.
4. User should be able to input the tolist fields above and populate the project div
5. Create 4 separate div. To-do, In-Progress, Done, and Blocked for project management sake
